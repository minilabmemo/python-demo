Hi, Jane! Did you hear about the new company policy?

No, what’s it about?

They now allow employees to work from home on Fridays.

Really? That's great news! It will allow me to spend more time with my family.

Yes, and it also allows us to save on commuting time and costs.

Do we need to get any special permission for that?

No, everyone is automatically allowed to work from home if they choose to.

That sounds very flexible. I’m glad the company is allowing this.

Me too. It’s nice to see them allowing more work-life balance.

Absolutely. This will definitely improve our productivity and morale.
